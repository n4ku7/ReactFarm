Running the AgriCraft React project (dev)

Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ and npm

Steps
1. Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

2. Start the dev server

```
npm run dev
```

3. Open the app

Open http://localhost:3001/ in your browser. Note: this project uses HashRouter, so routes will include a `#/` fragment (for example `http://localhost:3001/#/about`).

If port 3001 is already in use, Vite will try another port automatically; you can also edit `vite.config.js` to change the default port.
